# Freedom of Progression - 1.16.5 Modpack

Minecraft, in itself, is a sandbox game with an endless amount of possibilities, especially after the addition of modding. However, not every casual player can convert themselves into the hardcore gamer some mods expect them to be. This project is a new "just beginning", that casual players and veterans who wish to introduce their friends to the world of modding can enjoy. 

This modpack is continually being developed. Bug fixes are overly important, and can be reported to me through the issue tracker.

Donations, although not required, are extremely appreciated and can be done through my curseforge project page. On the right side of the project itself.

Published projects will be located at: https://www.curseforge.com/members/progressionisticcreations/projects

Hopefully, I can make this an enjoyable passtime/hobby and continue to do so for a while.
