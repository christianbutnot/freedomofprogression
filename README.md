# Minecraft Reimagined

Minecraft, in itself, is a sandbox game with an endless amount of possibilities, especially after the addition of modding. However, not every casual player can convert themselves into the hardcore gamer some mods expect them to be. This project is a new "just beginning", that casual players and veterans who wish to introduce their friends to the world of modding can enjoy. 

This modpack is in very early stages but will hopefully be fleshed out quite a lot in the coming weeks. Custom mods will slowly be introduced as I can create and polish them so that a beta of the pack can be tested by my fiance's discord members at: https://discord.gg/rrxnE9u

Development will be streamed over at my twitch: https://twitch.tv/ChristianButNot

Donations, although not required, are extremely appreciated and can be done through my streamlabs link, which can be found on my twitch account. 

Published projects will be located at: https://www.curseforge.com/members/christianbutnot/projects

Hopefully, I can make this an enjoyable passtime/hobby and continue to do so for a while.
